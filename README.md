Retrieve Public Repo of the GitHub User

This project is a Single Page Application using React which help retrieve public repo of a user given their GithHub username. If we enter a valid Github user ID, it should fetch all the public repositories of that user and list them down as display cards which contain certain details of the repo(i.e. repository name, description and the last updated date).

To run the application go inside the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
